# Understanding the Control Regions

**The code to produce the plots is available in the [Jupyter Nb](https://github.com/rishabhCMS/MonoTop-Leptonic/blob/master/2018_bkg_darhiggs/Darkhiggs_bkg_2018.ipynb)**

## Objective of this exercise

This exercise helped me understand the Control regions and has some important info about the DarkHiggs code

**The reason why the contribution od `W+LF + W+Hf` is higher than `TT` is because of the fact that `W+jets` has a far larger cross section and gives a far larger contribution than ttbar in this phase space**

This observation is going to change when the `Fat-jet is top-tagged`, we will observe that we will select `Ttbar` with a higher efficiency than `W+Jets`
thus, increasing the contribution of `ttbar`
