# Understanding the Control Regions

**The code to produce the plots is available in the [Jupyter Nb](https://github.com/rishabhCMS/MonoTop-Leptonic/blob/master/2018_bkg_darhiggs/Darkhiggs_bkg_2018.ipynb)**

## Objective of this exercise

This exercise helped me understand the Control regions and has some important info about the DarkHiggs code

**The reason why the contribution od `W+LF + W+Hf` is higher than `TT` is because of the fact that `W+jets` has a far larger cross section and gives a far larger contribution than ttbar in this phase space**

This observation is going to change when the `Fat-jet is top-tagged`, we will observe that we will select `Ttbar` with a higher efficiency than `W+Jets`
thus, increasing the contribution of `ttbar`


## Why CR?

in searches you look for exotic signals[11:33 AM] in this case[11:33 AM] for monotop production[11:33 AM] monotop production as peculiar characteristics[11:34 AM] for example, large MET and a top quark[11:34 AM] you then define a signal region composed by events that show, in fact, large MET and a top quark[11:35 AM] you expect this region to be enriched in monotop events[11:35 AM] but there will be contribution from other processes too, that you will call background processes[11:35 AM] these processes have characteristics that are similar to your signal[11:36 AM] that means that also these processes will show large MET and something similar to a top quark[11:36 AM] but they are not those signal[11:36 AM] for example[11:36 AM] Z+jets[11:37 AM] when the Z->neutrino-neutrino, that gives you the large MET[11:37 AM] and
 the jets produced in association with the Z that show similar kinematic
 properties to the jets that you would expect from an hadronic top[11:37 AM] in order to control this Z+jets background[11:38 AM] you define a control region, that is orthogonal to you signal region[11:38 AM]
